# Text-classifier
This is a text classifier which is having its model base on RNN coded in python 
This model trained by the dataset that is acquired from several novels. The dataset is basically the idea of emotion that we get from any particular paragraph.
There are four emotions among which we are going to classify our data Happy,Sad,Disgust,Surprise. 
If we want to test the model for any user defined input in the case we can store it in any text file and replace its location with the location of stry.txt in file.py. Then the emotion for that will be printed.
